# Hashtables
A hash table (hash map) is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values.
A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.


## Challenge
Implement a Hashtable Class with the following methods add(), get(), contains() and hash()

## Whiteboard
Lab 31:

![](c31.png)

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O(n) time and space because will walk through each element in linked list 
## API
add()-> to add to list


get()-> to get the index 


contains()-> returns Boolean indicating if the key exists in the table already.


hash()-> returns Index in the collection for that key

findFirstRepeated()-> returns the first repeated word
