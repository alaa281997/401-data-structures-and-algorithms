## Approach & Efficiency
 > code challenge 26 <br>
   Time : O(n^2) <br>
   Space: O(1) <br>
   Insertion sort takes maximum time to sort if elements are sorted in reverse order. And it takes minimum time (Order of n) when elements are already sorted.

   Space: O(n)
 

## Solution
 > [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
