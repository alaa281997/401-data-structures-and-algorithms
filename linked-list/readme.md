## Challenge
Challenge 5 about create linked list and how to insert elements in list and searching if the element inside the list <br>
Challenge 6 create 3 methods first method we need to add new to the end of the list the second method to insert before specific element and the last method for insert after specific element.


## Approach & Efficiency
 Linked list insertion : time O(1) / space : O(n)
 Linked list insertion : time O(n) / space : O(1)
